# huffman-compression-cpp
This project demonstrates the use of Huffman Coding, a popular lossless data compression algorithm.

* It calculates the frequency of each character in the input.

* Builds a min-heap to create the Huffman Tree.

* Assigns shorter codes to frequent characters and longer codes to less frequent ones.

* Encodes the input into a compressed binary form.

Allows saving compressed data into a binary file (.bin) and decoding it back to the original text.

ðŸ‘‰ This project shows how efficient file compression can be achieved with a simple but powerful algorithm.
